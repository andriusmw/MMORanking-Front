This is a website that allows players of World of Warcraft
who like to do Dungeons (Mythic+ keys) to have custom
End-Game Ranking made to fit all their needs.
<br/><br/>
You can do Dungeons in several difficulties from Normal
up to Mythic +10  ALONE or in groups of 2,3,4 or 5 players.
Once you finish a dungeon, you can upload the log 
to warcraft logs website and copy the correct link
on this website so we put that data into our ladders.
<br/><br/>
So you basically have a ranking for 1,2,3,4 and 5 players.
Play as you like most the class you like most, no more waiting
no more anger for loosing keys just test your skills and Enjoy!
