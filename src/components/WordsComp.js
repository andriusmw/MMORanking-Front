This is a website that allows players of World of Warcraft
who like to do Dungeons (Mythic+ keys) to have custom
End-Game Ranking made to fit all their needs.
<br/><br/>
You can do Dungeons in several difficulties from Normal
up to Mythic +10  ALONE or in groups of 2,3,4 or 5 players.
Once you finish a dungeon, you can upload the log 
to warcraft logs website and copy the correct link
on this website so we put that data into our ladders.
<br/><br/>
So you basically have a timed ranking for every Dungeon in game clasified by Difficulty,
 Number of players, Class, Spec and  Server avalible to 
players in the whole world. 
Play as you like most the class you like most, no more waiting
no more anger for loosing keys. Play as you want to test your skills alone or 
with your friends only or in a mixed group of friends and random people and Enjoy!
